# Generalizing and Improving Weight Initialization
This software allows users to reproduce the results in Generalizing and Improving Weight Initialization, Dan Hendrycks and Kevin Gimpel 2016.

The files cifar10_vgg.py, cnn_lstm.py, and mnist_feedforward_train_and_test.py led to the paper's results. In addition to these files, appendices.py allows for visual comparison between the different initializations in an artificial setting.
